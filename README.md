# StopTimer

This project creates a stop timer or what you might call a stopwatch using html, css, and JavaScript.
I have not properly commented the code but I have used variable and function names that are immediately intuitive.
I hope this project helps users understand the basic use of the document.getElementById() component, because I use this mainly to access the document objects to simplify
comprehension of the project instead of confusing or distracting you with codes.
There are several ways to create this stop.
